1. Project Overview

This is my first analytics project, built entirely from scratch to gain hands-on experience in analyzing real-world marketing campaign performance using SQL and Power BI. The project involved working with a dataset containing multiple campaign metrics across different clients, campaign types, regions, and time periods.

The primary objective of this project was to develop the ability to transform raw data into actionable business insights. I focused on calculating key performance metrics such as Click-Through Rate (CTR), Conversion Rate (CVR), proposals accepted, revenue generated, and engagement per campaign, and visualizing these insights to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for improvement.

Additionally, this project allowed me to practice data cleaning, aggregation, and analysis techniques, as well as create dynamic and interactive dashboards in Power BI that can assist marketing teams in making data-driven decisions. By connecting SQL queries directly to Power BI, I explored the end-to-end process of data extraction, transformation, analysis, and visualization, simulating a real-world business analytics workflow.

Overall, this project strengthened my analytical thinking, problem-solving skills, and technical proficiency, while also giving me a practical understanding of how data can influence strategic marketing decisions. It serves as a foundation for more advanced analytics projects and demonstrates my ability to independently handle data-driven projects from start to finish.
